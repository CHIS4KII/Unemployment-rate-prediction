# Unemployment-rate-prediction
 Project Overview

This project analyzes unemployment rates by gender and age group across different countries from 2014 to 2024. The data is visualized on a world map using GeoPandas, and a Linear Regression Model is applied to analyze trends over time.
 Dataset

The dataset contains:

Country Names

Unemployment Rate (%) from 2014 to 2024

Gender & Age Group Categories

Mean Unemployment Rate (Calculated)

 Visualization

A choropleth map is created using GeoPandas.

Color-coded unemployment rates help identify trends by country.

Technologies Used

Python

GeoPandas (for mapping)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for plotting)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (for linear regression analysis)

Results & Insights

Certain countries show a consistent rise in unemployment rates.

Gender-based disparities in unemployment are evident.

The Linear Regression Model suggests increasing unemployment in some regions.
